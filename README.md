A Game made with UNITY 3D. Mix of 2D and 3D elements


I was trying to learn about games and playability and after some time studying I was able to create this game. It far from a good quality level, but still can be a inspiration for some thing.

Facts about:

*    The characters of this games are made with 2D sprites.
*    Scenario is made with 3D elements create with Google Scratch
*    I haven't check the assets' license
